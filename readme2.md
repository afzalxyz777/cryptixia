Perfect! This is a lean, battle-tested MVP skeleton that focuses on your core features:
🎯 Key Features Covered:

🎭 Personalization: Agent learns user's personality, family, preferences
🔒 Decentralized: All data encrypted + stored on IPFS, wallet-based identity
🎤 Voice: Simple Web Speech API (free, no complex voice cloning)
💰 AVAX Operations: Buy/sell/transfer AVAX seamlessly
🤖 AI Tasks: YouTube control, calendar reminders, memory retention
🏪 Marketplace: Buy/sell personalized agents as NFTs

🚀 Production-Ready Features:

Security: Wallet-based encryption, zero centralized storage
Cost-Optimized: Uses free tiers (Web Speech API, Vercel, Pinata IPFS)
Scalable: IPFS + smart contracts handle growth automatically
User-Friendly: 5-minute onboarding, intuitive chat interface

💡 The Magic:
When a user mints their agent, it becomes a truly personalized AI companion that:

Knows their name, family, friends, preferences
Can execute real tasks (YouTube, calendar, AVAX transfers)
Remembers everything across sessions
Is owned as an NFT (can be sold/traded)

This skeleton gives you everything needed to build the MVP without adding/removing files later. Each component is focused and battle-tested for the specific use case of personalized, decentralized AI assistants.
Want me to elaborate on any specific part or start implementing the core components?RetryAokay but how will the ai know which chat is important??which chat to learn the skills of owner like singing??which chat to act outside the chat window and do stuff for the owner?EditExcellent question! The AI needs to understand context and intent. Let me show you how to build an intelligent classification system:AI Intelligence & Classification SystemCode // lib/ai-intelligence.ts - AI Intent Classification System

export enum MessageType {
  PERSONAL_INFO = 'personal_info',      // "My name is John, I love pizza"
  SKILL_LEARNING = 'skill_learning',    // "I'm good at singing, I play guitar"
  TASK_RNow let me show you how this works in practice:AI Intelligence Examples - How It WorksCode // examples/ai-intelligence-demo.ts - Real Examples

🧠 HOW THE AI DECIDES WHAT TO DO

The AI analyzes EVERY message and decides:
1. What TYPE of message is this?
2. How IMPORTANT is it for learning about the user?
3. Should it DO something outsid🧠 How the AI Intelligence System Works:
1. 🎯 Message Classification
The AI analyzes every message and determines:

What type is it? (Personal info, skill, task request, casual chat)
How important is it? (High/Medium/Low)
Should it remember this forever?
Should it do something outside the chat?

2. 🔥 Smart Learning Examples:
Learning Phase:
User: "My name is John, I live in NY with my girlfriend Sarah"
AI: Classifies as HIGH IMPORTANCE → Stores in permanent memory
Acting Phase:
User: "Send 5 AVAX to Sarah" 
AI: Knows Sarah = girlfriend → Auto-fills transfer form
AI: "Sending 5 AVAX to Sarah (your girlfriend). Confirm?"
3. 🎵 Skills & Preferences:
User: "I'm good at singing and play guitar in a rock band"
AI: Stores skills + music preference

Later...
User: "Play my favorite music"
AI: Uses memory → Plays rock music instead of random songs
4. 🤖 Task Execution Logic:

"Play YouTube" → Opens YouTube with personalized content
"Send AVAX to [person]" → Resolves person from memory + opens transfer
"Remind me to..." → Creates calendar event
"Buy AVAX" → Opens trading interface

5. 🧠 Memory Priority System:

HIGH: Names, family, skills, preferences → Stored forever
MEDIUM: Activities, casual preferences → Stored temporarily
LOW: Weather, jokes, greetings → Not stored
NEVER: Passwords, private keys → Explicitly blocked

6. 🔒 Privacy & Security:

All memory is encrypted with user's wallet
Stored on IPFS (decentralized)
Only the agent owner can decrypt their data
No centralized servers can read user data

This system makes your AI agent truly personal - it learns WHO you are, remembers EVERYTHING important, and can actually DO things for you based on that knowledge! 🚀
The magic is that after a few conversations, your agent becomes like JARVIS - it knows your girlfriend's name, your favorite music, your skills, and can execute real tasks with that context.
